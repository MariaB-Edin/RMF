Then pull the documentation of the estat ovtest command. Note how the test output and the documentation talks about omitted variables – which is imprecise. Remember the RESET test cannot test for omitted variables in general, these is no such statistical test. The RESET test only suggests a different functional form of some x-s might be better."
